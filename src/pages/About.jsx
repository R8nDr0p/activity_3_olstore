            <h1>Company History</h1>
            <p>
              So, the reason I started my company making ergonomic keyboards is
              because I used to experience a lot of pain and discomfort in my
              hands and wrists after typing for long periods of time on a
              regular keyboard. I did some research and discovered ergonomic
              keyboards, which are designed to reduce strain and improve comfort
              during extended typing sessions. The problem was, I found that the
              options on the market were pretty limited and often too expensive.
              So, with my background in engineering and product design, I
              decided to create my own company focused on designing and
              manufacturing high-quality, ergonomic keyboards that were more
              affordable and accessible to everyone. I spent a lot of time
              testing different materials and designs, and working with
              ergonomics experts to make sure my keyboards were the best they
              could be. And finally, after months of hard work, I launched my
              company and released my first line of ergonomic keyboards, which
              quickly gained a following among professionals who valued their
              health and comfort. Since then, my company has grown and expanded
              to include a range of ergonomic accessories, like wrist rests and
              ergonomic mice. And today, we're recognized as a leader in the
              ergonomic keyboard market, with a reputation for quality,
              innovation, and affordability.
